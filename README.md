# Insider Threat Detection Using Log Analysis

### Ubuntu and Windows Configuration

## Ubuntu Configuration for Log Collection

**(Your existing Ubuntu configuration steps)**

## Windows Configuration for Log Collection

### 1\. Installing Splunk Universal Forwarder on Windows

  * **Mention the MSI Installer:** Typically, articles like the one you cited highlight the use of the MSI installer for ease of deployment on Windows. You could add a point about downloading the appropriate MSI installer from the Splunk website.
  * **Silent Installation:** These guides often cover performing silent installations using the command line (`msiexec.exe`) with parameters for specifying the installation directory, Splunk server IP, and deployment server (if applicable). You might want to include an example of a silent install command.
  * **Configuration via Command Line:** Explain that the forwarder can be configured during installation or via command-line tools after installation to specify the Splunk server and any initial configurations.

### 2\. Configuring Windows Event Logs for Collection

  * **Event Log Channels:** Emphasize the importance of configuring the forwarder to collect relevant Windows Event Log channels for insider threat detection (e.g., Security, Application, System).
  * **`inputs.conf` on Windows:** Explain that, similar to Ubuntu, the `inputs.conf` file on the Windows forwarder (located in `%SPLUNK_HOME%\etc\system\local\`) is used to specify which event log channels to monitor. Provide an example of how to configure this.
  * **Using the Splunk Web Interface (if applicable):** Some deployment methods might involve initial configuration through the Splunk web interface on the forwarder host (if temporarily enabled).

### 3\. Deployment Strategies (Mentioned in the Article?)

  * The Hurricane Labs article might discuss different deployment strategies, such as manual installation on each machine or using deployment tools. Briefly mentioning these could be beneficial.

**Example of how you might integrate a point:**

Instead of just saying "Configure forwarder to send logs to Splunk server:", you could elaborate based on the Windows context:

```bash
# Ubuntu (Existing)
sudo /opt/splunkforwarder/bin/splunk add forward-server <SPLUNK_SERVER_IP>:9997
```

````

**To effectively integrate the content from the Hurricane Labs article:**

1.  **Open the Hurricane Labs article.**
2.  **Identify the key steps and configurations they describe for Windows deployment.**
3.  **Adapt those steps and explanations to fit the structure and tone of your README.**
4.  **Provide specific commands, file paths (using Windows conventions like `%SPLUNK_HOME%`), and configuration examples relevant to Windows.**

By following this approach, you can seamlessly incorporate the valuable insights from the Hurricane Labs article into your project's README, providing a comprehensive guide for configuring both Ubuntu and Windows machines for log collection in your insider threat detection project. Let me know if you have any other questions\!
